# Practical applications of simulated annealing - global optimization

Make sure to have packages listed in `requirements.txt`. <br>
You can install them by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip` - depends on your system).

## Iris dataset classification
Optimization of the neural network weights with simulated annealing to solve classification task on the iris dataset.

All of the code is done in `iris_classification.ipynb` file. <br>
> To run the code please consider using `jupyter notebook` or `google colab` to execute the notebook content.

## Travelling salesman problem solution
Solution for the traveling salesman problem using simulated annealing global optimization algorithm (combinatorial optimization). 

Dataset of russian cities was taken from [here](https://github.com/hflabs/city.git). Top 30 most populated cities were considered. Dataset path is `data/city.csv`.

All of the code is done in `travelling_salesman.ipynb` file. <br>
> To run the code please consider using `jupyter notebook` or `google colab` to execute the notebook content.

Here is the visualization of the algorithm's work (`images/algo_animation.gif`).
